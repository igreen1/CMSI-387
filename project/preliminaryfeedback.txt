'alias' mod ~ make an alias permanent from the command line

This is a great idea!  I am a big fan of aliasing commands, as you have seen
and it is a real hassle when I think of something that I'd like to alias,
because you have to go edit the .bashrc file and add it, then source it, to
make it active.  It can be confusing if you are working with an editor, too,
since in the terminal window you probably DON'T have a copy of vxcode or
atom or sublime available, so you'll be changing editor commands right in
the middle of what you're doing, which is error-prone.

This should be VERY cool to see work and is VERY useful.

Semester so far:
   homework01 87.50% * 10 points =  8.75 points
   delivery01 100.0% * 10 points = 10.00 points
                          total:   18.75 out of 20 = 93.80% which is an A

Keep up the great work, you three!
