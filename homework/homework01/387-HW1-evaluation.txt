Nice work!

Thanks for your input about security!  It is a most interesting and critical
topic given the state of the world at present, and I was lucky enough to do
some work with that at Boeing.  I'll do my best to include security in class
as the semester continues.

Nice presentation on the Gantt chart, but you seem to have omitted a few of
the cases.  You should have 6 charts, showing all six possible combinations
for the three threads.  The average turnaround times for each combination
should be calculated, then the shortest of those used to determine the policy
of the scheduler.  The policy determination is missing.

You didn't follow the instructions for number 7.  You are supposed to output
the data using a *SINGLE* printf() statement.  You have six of them.

Otherwise, good job!
