Nice work!  Just a couple of comments:

Your dining phil program works, but gave me 4 compiler warnings which you
should have tracked down so it would produce a "clean" compilation.  Still,
you earn nearly full credit.

Your problem 3 was supposed to have been done in "C" *NOT* in C++.  It works
so you earn nearly full credit.

Excellent thinking to put the text files for question 4 into a zip!  Thx!
